Offensive Security Researcher by day, digital locksmith by night. I’m Netsec—your local IT specialist who balances a deep obsession with machine exploitation with a habit of documenting the beautiful chaos of the process.

## What To Expect Here
This is more than a repository; it’s a transparent look into my offensive security process. Each entry focuses on the underlying principles of the breach rather than just the execution. The goal isn't to provide a cheat sheet, but to bridge the gap between running a command and mastering the machine.
